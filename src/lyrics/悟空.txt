[00:55.410]
[00:57.780]舍悟离迷
[00:59.600]
[01:00.290]六尘不改
[01:02.630]
[01:04.730]且怒且悲且狂哉
[01:07.060]
[01:08.150]是人是鬼是妖怪
[01:10.000]
[01:11.020]不过是
[01:12.780]
[01:14.350]心有魔债
[01:16.770]
[01:17.970]叫一声佛祖
[01:20.960]回头无岸
[01:23.180]
[01:25.110]跪一人为师
[01:27.920]生死无关
[01:30.740]
[01:32.610]善恶浮世真假界
[01:35.230]
[01:36.050]尘缘散聚不分明
[01:39.110]难断
[01:40.930]
[01:42.660]我要
[01:43.810]
[01:44.480]这铁棒有何用
[01:48.100]
[01:49.710]我有
[01:50.870]
[01:51.440]这变化又如何
[01:55.060]
[01:56.030]还是不安
[01:58.640]
[01:59.380]还是氐惆
[02:02.180]
[02:03.440]金箍当头
[02:04.950]
[02:05.630]欲说还休
[02:09.300]
[02:26.390]我要
[02:27.330]

[02:31.480]
[02:33.210]我有
[02:34.890]这变化乱迷浊
[02:38.660]
[02:39.460]踏碎灵霄
[02:42.590]放肆桀骜
[02:45.580]
[02:46.930]世恶道险
[02:49.040]终究难逃
[02:52.560]
[02:54.920]这一棒
[02:58.730]
[02:59.270]叫你灰飞烟灭
